# Practical_Project_Deep_Learning

Task:

- Find whichever dataset you want for polynomial multiple regression or non-linearly separable classification (you can use/generate the same scikit/python dataset or find real one)
- Train & tune a deep neural network using two frameworks (choose from TF/keras, pytorch, fast.ai)
